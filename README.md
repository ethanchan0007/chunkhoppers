# Retrohoppers

Chunk hoppers with upgrades and a filter! Configuration support will be handled when I decide to publicly release this plugin!

### Prerequisites

This plugin supports Spigot 1.8-1.12.2, will add support for newer versions on public release.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Downloading

At the moment, you can build Retrohoppers via Maven using ```mvn clean package```.
